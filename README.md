# About

`Carlzberg` should become a CMS created in `golang`. Even though there are already many CMS outside none of them did exactly what I wanted them to be. Therefore I decided to create `Carlzberg`

# Naming

The name `Carlzberg` basically originated from two thoughts. In the first place I used some fancy online name generator to provide some names for this project as I was somehow uncreative which initially setting up this project. While browsing the name suggestions `Carlzberg` crossed my way. This made come up my second thought which points to a former employer where this name was used to point to a development. These two thoughts in combination lead me to the conclusion that this will be a good name for this project.
